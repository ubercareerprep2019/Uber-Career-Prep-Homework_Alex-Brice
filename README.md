Assignment_1.

I have tried my best solving all problems. Some important points:

1. I was a little pressed with time on Part3 (Stack). This was due to the fact 
that an earlier implementation included generics (instead of integer), 
and this caused some confusion when implementing min(). 
Therefore, the min() routine is written but not tested. Ultimately, due to time constraints,
I decided to keep generics. I will keep working on it. 

2. Needless to say, Part5 was very challenging. I did my best. There are still some 
areas that I still need to improve on. 
Some highlights:
a. I implemented moveDisk as a recursive routine.
b. The instance variables are the three rods represented as arrays.
   There are also 3 arraylists that store successive updates of the 
   arrays that represent the rods, as the program is running. 
   I am aware that the use of arraylist of arrays might be too space
   inefficient. 
  
 c. disksAtRod will just return the last disk of the arraylist. 
 
 3. The other Parts of the assignment work well.
